JAVA Naming Conventions:-
-------------------------
In Java for good maintenance and readability  of code.

Java uses CAMEL CASE as a practice for writing names of:
1. Variables
2. Methods
3. Classess and Interfaces
4. Packages
5. Constants

Camel case in Java Programming:
1. 1st letter should be CAPITALS, followed by the lower case. Example:- VikramKadam, FedEx etx.,

2. Classess and Interfaces :- Class names should be nouns,1st letter should be CAPITALS, Rest should be lower case and same applies for Interface as well.
              Examples:

              Interface  Bicycle
              Class MountainBike implements Bicyle

              Interface Sport
              Class Football implements Sport

3. Methods :- Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase and with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.
              Examples:

              void changeGear(int newValue);
              void speedUp(int increment);
              void applyBrakes(int decrement);

4. Variables : Variable names should be short yet meaningful.
     4.1 Should not start with underscore(‘_’) or dollar sign ‘$’ characters.
     4.2 Should be mnemonic i.e, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use.
     4.3 One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary variables.
     4.4 Common names for temporary variables are i, j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.
              Examples:

              int speed = 0;
              int gear = 1;


5. Constant variables:
     5.1 Should be all uppercase with words separated by underscores (“_”).
     5.2 There are various constants used in predefined classes like Float, Long, String etc.\
              Examples:

              static final int MIN_WIDTH = 4;

              // Some  Constant variables used in predefined Float class
              public static final float POSITIVE_INFINITY = 1.0f / 0.0f;
              public static final float NEGATIVE_INFINITY = -1.0f / 0.0f;
              public static final float NaN = 0.0f / 0.0f;

6. Packages:
   The prefix of a unique package name is always written in all-lowercase ASCII letters and
   should be one of the top-level domain names, like com, edu, gov, mil, net, org.
   Subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organization’s own internal naming conventions.
              Examples:

              com.sun.eng
              com.apple.quicktime.v2

              // java.lang packet in JDK
              java.lang
